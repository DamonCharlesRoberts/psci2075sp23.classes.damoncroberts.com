# 👋 Welcome {.unnumbered #sec-welcome}

I am glad to have you in my recitation sections for PSCI 2075!

I am looking forward to working together in this class. 

This document provides a reference guide for you to look back on throughout the semester. This is not a supplement for attending lecture, recitation, or for taking notes. It also is not a study guide. This is simply a reference guide. 📑
