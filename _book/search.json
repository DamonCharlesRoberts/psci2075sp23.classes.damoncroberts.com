    "text": "Purpose of a recitation\nThe purpose of my part in delivering the course for you, as all college courses should be viewed, is not to ‚Äúlose points‚Äù or to earn a grade. üíØ üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Rather, I see our journey this semester as a collaborative effort for you to build knowledge to make you a more effective democratic citizen and for me to work with the instructor of record to give you a very small introduction to a potential career path. We provide you with information we think is relevant for this goal and your job is to learn it.\nRecitations meet separately from lecture but are still required. The purpose of a recitation, especially for large classes, is to help you, the student, to have a meeting time separate from lecture that reviews the lecture material and to provide a more in depth conversations. Recitations are a supplement to what you learn in lecture. In the recitation, broadly speaking, we will review and discuss the assigned readings for the class and will clarify any points of confusion from the material covered in the lecture. For this recitation, we will also take a deeper dive into the R code that allows researchers to perform many of these statistical computations we discuss in lecture.\nAs a student üßë‚Äçüéì, your goal for the recitation is to come prepared with questions üôã and, if you have none, to do the work to understand the material. My goal, as the instructor for this recitation üßë‚Äçüè´, is to guide your learning so that you get more in-depth understanding of the material for the class.\nFor many, this is a required class that you are taking to complete your degree and are not interested in the material ü´†. My other goal is to at least introduce and convince you of the complexity of data analysis and the importance of having a basic understanding of the ways in which data analysis is not purely objective ü§Ø.\nThe format of the recitations and the material for the course is determined by the faculty teaching the class. I, however, will do what I can to be flexible to the needs of the students for my recitations to maximize your learning."

    "section": "Contacting me ‚úâÔ∏è",
    "text": "Contacting me ‚úâÔ∏è\nYou should feel free to contact me throughout the semester. I encourage you to come to office hours so that I can help answer any questions you have about the course policies, the material covered in the class, any concerns you have, questions about navigating University, offering additional materials if there is a topic you are really interested in, etcetera üôè. You are also welcomed to email me. I am usually responsive to email Monday-Friday from 9 AM ‚Äì 5 PM (I may take a day or two, but I will get back to you). Please do note that email is not instantaneous communication; it is not a text message or a DM üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Despite my best intentions, I receive too many emails and try to manage a decent work-life balance. This means that you if you have questions for me and send them over email, you should be prepared for a response to take a day or two. In other words, do not send me an email right before an assignment is due or some other deadline.\n\nHow to refer to me\nI am a PhD Candidate, which means I have not yet recieved my PhD - but I am in the last stages of the process, so my title is not yet Dr.¬†Roberts. I am the instructor of the recitation, so it is totally appropriate to refer to me as Professor Roberts or Mr.¬†Roberts.\nI go back and forth with this, but I am generally comfortable with students referring to me by my first name - with a caveat. Female faculty and faculty of color face a several barriers in academia. One part of this is that students often treat female faculty and faculty of color as if they have less authority and expertise over their respective subject material. These biases manifest in a number of ways. One common way is that students feel more comfortable referring to their non-white male faculty without an acknowledgement of their titles. Feeling comfortable with students being less formal with me is a reflection of my unearned privilege as a white male.\nBecause I am comfortable with less formal interactions with my students, you should not assume other instructors and faculty are as well. Unless a faculty member explicitly tells you that it is okay to refer to them by their first name, you should only refer to them as Professor LASTNAME. This is a safe option for faculty that may not or may not yet have a PhD where referring to them as Dr.¬†LASTNAME may not be appropriate.\n\n\nStudent hours\nMany faculty call these office hours. I prefer to use the term student hours since it is what they really are. Student hours are designated times I (and all faculty and TA‚Äôs) set aside each week for students to visit me in my office. I will always be in my office during these designated times, so feel free to stop by. These hours are your chance to ask questions about the course material, about university in general, or just to chat so that we can get to know one another. Many students come to student hours after a test wondering what they need to know to prepare for an exam; however, I encourage you to come with questions before the exam. Student hours are most helpful to students if you have done some studying before coming to my office and having concrete questions about material you are struggling with. When you come in with substantive questions about the course material, I can explain a course concept a different way or help you work through a problem."

They do not override nor provide complete information about the course. You can think of this as an addendum where I can present information about how my recitation sections will operate.\n\n\nIn the first five minutes of each recitation meeting, I will post a question to the board based on that week‚Äôs material (reading or lecture). You will need to submit an answer to that question in those first five minutes. üìù\nThe purpose of the questions are for me to gauge everyone‚Äôs progress with the course. üí™ I do not want my students to fall behind and to slip through the cracks. I want to make sure that if you are struggling, that you are offered opportunities to receive help (should you choose to accept it). These questions will give me a weekly insight into where you are with the material and it gives me a sense of where the group is as a whole. This helps me customize what we focus on in recitation based on the needs of the group.\nSubmission of these questions each week will also help with taking attendance and participation. This encourages you to come to recitation and to come on time (there is not much benefit if you arrive to our recitation meeting with only 10 minutes left). If you submit a response to a question (even if you get it incorrect), you will receive credit for attendance that week. To receive credit for participation that week, a correct (or almost correct) answer to that week‚Äôs question will give you credit for the participation component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPer the policies of the course, you are able to not submit a total of three (3) of these weekly questions before you begin to lose points toward your Attendance & Participation grade. The three misses can be for any reason such as arriving late, not attending class, not answering the question, etc. This means you should use these three misses when you absolutely need them."

With a couple of exceptions: - To create a header use #. For subheadings, just add another #. E.g., ## creates a subheader. - To create an unumbered list, just type -; for numbered list just type the numbers. To make sublists, just type:\n- List item 1\n    - Sub list item 1\n1. Numbered list item 1\n2. Numbered list item 2\n\n\n5.3.3 Code Chunks\nIf it weren‚Äôt for R code, I‚Äôd make my life easier and skip all of this by writing all of this in a .docx or a Google Docs file. ü§¶ So let‚Äôs learn how to create a code chunk in a .qmd file. The ability to write your code and text all to display your analyses results along with your interpretation in the same document is where Quarto is powerful. üí™\n```{r}\n#| label: one-plus-one\n1+1\n```\nTo create a code chunk for R, you need to identify a few things:\n\nFirst you need to tell the .qmd file where the code chunk starts and ends. This is done with the accent symbol. You should have six of these in total. Three to designate the start of the code chunk and three at the end of the code chunk.\nAt the start of the code chunk, you need to need to specify which coding language you are evaluating in the code chunk within the brackets ({}). Since we are writing R code, we have {R}\nDirectly underneath the start of the code chunk, you can include some options about what you want to happen with the code chunk. These options are designated with #|. The option you should always specify is the label option. This option names the code chunk: one-plus-one. We do this because when we compile our .qmd file later, it tells us about the progress of our code blocks and can tell us in what code chunk there is an error in our code (which inevitably happens; even to the best of us)\n\nThere are other options that we can specify. But we‚Äôll cover these a bit later.\nOnce we have done that, then we can write our R code. In this case we want to evaluate the expression: \\(1+1\\)\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Inline code chunks\nSay we want to evaluate the same expression \\(1+1\\) and display the result in line with our text. We can do that by writing:\nThe result of the expression 1+1 is ```{r} sprintf('%.2f', 1+1)```.\nYou don‚Äôt need to understand all the specifics of what the sprintf('%.2f',) part does. It basically just lets you display some integer value to the hundredth decimal place. The part after the , is the R code we want evaluated. So 1+1 in this case. This all together will print the number 2 instead of you manually typing that in.\nWhy would anyone want to do that to make it more complicated? In the case of \\(1+1\\) that is a pretty simple expression with a pretty simple result. However, as things get more complicated, you may not want to have to do that manually such as calculating the average of some set of data.\n\n\n5.3.5 Non-inline results\nThe inline code chunks are primarily useful for displaying the results of some R code ‚Äúinline‚Äù with the text you are writing. But what if I have a table or a graph of some sort of results I want to display?\nThis is where specifying those other options come in handy.\nSay I write the following R code to generate a graph (we‚Äôll teach you what this R code means later)\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-chart-1\n#| fig-cap: A histogram of Penguin Bill Lengths\n\nggplot() +\n    geom_histogram(data=MY_DATASET, aes(x=bill_length)) +\n    labs(x = \"Bill Lengths\", caption=\"Data Source: Palmer Penguins\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\nDon‚Äôt worry about the R code to create the graph for now. What is important to notice about this part is, the options we specified.\n\nWith label I specify that it is going to be a figure with fig- and then finish the name with chart-1\nWith fig-cap I define a title to give the figure.\n\nWhen I compile my document and it evaluates this code block, instead of it displaying the code, it will display the figure.\nIf I want to reference the figure. I can simply type:\n\n@fig-chart-1 displays a histogram of the bill length for the penguins in the Palmer Penguins dataset.\nThis will create a link connecting back to the figure for your reader. Pretty cool!"

    "text": "6.2 Objects\nObjects represent the temporarily stored (cached) result of any operation/function in R.\nYou define objects with the assignment operator (<-).\nHere is an example:\nSay that I want to evaluate the expression \\(1+1\\). But say I want to access the result of that expression later. Either because I don‚Äôt want to rerun the code or if I want to store the result and do some other things to it later.\nI can create an object to store the result of me evaluating the expression \\(1+1\\). R stores this object in your environment (see Chapter¬†3) and will stay accessible to you until you close out of RStudio (RStudio Team 2020).\n\n# Define a = 1+1\na <- 1+1\n\nSo with the code chunk above, what does a represent?\nLet‚Äôs check:\n\nprint(a)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs say that I want to evaluate the expression \\(1+1+1\\) later in my code. But I already evaluated part of this expression with \\(1+1\\)! Since I stored the result in a, I can just evaluate the expression \\(a+1\\) which is equivalent to \\(1+1+1\\).\n\n# Evaluate a+1\nb <- a+1\n\nWe should expect that \\(b=3\\):\n\nprint(b)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Functions\nFunctions are a specific type of object.\nFunctions are simply an object that takes an input and does something to that input. R is full of functions.\nSome examples of functions that we have already dealt with:\n\n<-: The input is the object and the name you want to assign the object\n+: The input are the numbers you want to sum\n\nFunctions more generally are predefined with underlying code (often very complex) that do some task for you. They are a shortcut so that you don‚Äôt have to rewrite that same code. Otherwise, everyone‚Äôs scripts would be much longer than they are.\nAs functions are a specific type of object, the whole idea behind a function is to only need to write the code once; rather than multiple times throughout a script.\nWe can write our own functions (advanced topic we aren‚Äôt going to go over), and we can access the functions written by other people to make our life easier.\nWhen someone writes a function and want to share it, they often have other related functions and code. They can package all of this code into a library and submit it to code repositories such as Github or CRAN (where you downloaded R; because what you downloaded came with basic functions like + and <-).\nIf there is a function that someone has written and packaged, you will need to install the underlying code onto your computer so that you can use it for your own work.\n\n6.2.1.1 Installing packages\nTo install a package from CRAN (often the default place to download packages from), you can use the built-in function install.packages()\n```{r}\n# Install some package called FakePackage\ninstall.packages(\"FakePackage\")\n\n# Install some package called FakePackage and another called OtherPackage\ninstall.packages(c(\"FakePackage\", \"OtherPackage\"))\n```\nThe install.package() function takes an input ‚Äì the name of the package you want to install (surrounded by quotations) ‚Äì and it will then perform some action with that input ‚Äì download the underlying code for that package and function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe input for this and other functions ARE case-sensitive.\nFor example, if I ran the following instead:\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"fakepackage\")\n```\nI would get an error!\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1.2 Loading packages\nNow, how do I use my function?\nWell, you‚Äôve downloaded the package containing the function that you want to use, but you will need to now load it to your environment. Why? Well, again, remember that functions are just a type of object. More practically, think about the number of packages some one like me has on my computer. If every time I opened R, it automatically loaded all of that code, then my computer would probably melt. So instead, I just want to specify what I want to load.\nThere are a couple of options: 1. Most people load the entire package by writing:\n```{r}\n# Load packages\nlibrary(FakePackage) # load FakePackage\n```\n\nModularly loading only the functions you want from your packages with the box package (Rudolph and Schubert 2022):\n\n```{r}\n# Load packages\nbox::use(\n    FakePackage = FakePackage[FunctionIWant, OtherFunctionIWant], # Load FunctionIWant and OtherFunctionIWant in FakePackage\n    OtherPackage = [...] # load all functions in OtherPackage\n)\n```\nWhat are the benefits of the second option?\n\nI load only the functions that I actually am going to use\nSometimes functions can be named the same thing, do different things, and are from different packages. This can create a lot of confusion and can even lead to errors in R if R is confused about what to use. Loading things purposefully, you can identify all of this before you try to run it.\nPuts less strain on my computer\nEasier to read. Now I can see what functions I got from which package rather than it just loading everything from the packages I loaded with library()\n\nTo use one of the two options:\n\nUsing library(): No extra steps, library() comes with R when you downloaded it ‚Äì from the base-r package (technically)\nUsing box::use(): Need to install the box package. And then you can just use the code from above!\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"box\")\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Team. 2020. RStudio: Integrated Development Environment for r.
