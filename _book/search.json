    "text": "Purpose of a recitation\nThe purpose of my part in delivering the course for you, as all college courses should be viewed, is not to ‚Äúlose points‚Äù or to earn a grade. üíØ üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Rather, I see our journey this semester as a collaborative effort for you to build knowledge to make you a more effective democratic citizen and for me to work with the instructor of record to give you a very small introduction to a potential career path. We provide you with information we think is relevant for this goal and your job is to learn it.\nRecitations meet separately from lecture but are still required. The purpose of a recitation, especially for large classes, is to help you, the student, to have a meeting time separate from lecture that reviews the lecture material and to provide a more in depth conversations. Recitations are a supplement to what you learn in lecture. In the recitation, broadly speaking, we will review and discuss the assigned readings for the class and will clarify any points of confusion from the material covered in the lecture. For this recitation, we will also take a deeper dive into the R code that allows researchers to perform many of these statistical computations we discuss in lecture.\nAs a student üßë‚Äçüéì, your goal for the recitation is to come prepared with questions üôã and, if you have none, to do the work to understand the material. My goal, as the instructor for this recitation üßë‚Äçüè´, is to guide your learning so that you get more in-depth understanding of the material for the class.\nFor many, this is a required class that you are taking to complete your degree and are not interested in the material ü´†. My other goal is to at least introduce and convince you of the complexity of data analysis and the importance of having a basic understanding of the ways in which data analysis is not purely objective ü§Ø.\nThe format of the recitations and the material for the course is determined by the faculty teaching the class. I, however, will do what I can to be flexible to the needs of the students for my recitations to maximize your learning."

    "text": "Contacting me ‚úâÔ∏è\nYou should feel free to contact me throughout the semester. I encourage you to come to office hours so that I can help answer any questions you have about the course policies, the material covered in the class, any concerns you have, questions about navigating University, offering additional materials if there is a topic you are really interested in, etcetera üôè. You are also welcomed to email me. I am usually responsive to email Monday-Friday from 9 AM ‚Äì 5 PM (I may take a day or two, but I will get back to you). Please do note that email is not instantaneous communication; it is not a text message or a DM üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Despite my best intentions, I receive too many emails and try to manage a decent work-life balance. This means that you if you have questions for me and send them over email, you should be prepared for a response to take a day or two. In other words, do not send me an email right before an assignment is due or some other deadline.\n\nHow to refer to me\nI am a PhD Candidate, which means I have not yet received my PhD - but I am in the last stages of the process, so my title is not yet Dr.¬†Roberts. I am the instructor of the recitation, so it is totally appropriate to refer to me as Professor Roberts or Mr.¬†Roberts.\nI go back and forth with this, but I am generally comfortable with students referring to me by my first name - with a caveat. Female faculty and faculty of color face a several barriers in academia. One part of this is that students often treat female faculty and faculty of color as if they have less authority and expertise over their respective subject material. These biases manifest in a number of ways. One common way is that students feel more comfortable referring to their non-white male faculty without an acknowledgement of their titles. Feeling comfortable with students being less formal with me is a reflection of my unearned privilege as a white male.\nBecause I am comfortable with less formal interactions with my students, you should not assume other instructors and faculty are as well. Unless a faculty member explicitly tells you that it is okay to refer to them by their first name, you should only refer to them as Professor LASTNAME. This is a safe option for faculty that may not or may not yet have a PhD where referring to them as Dr.¬†LASTNAME may not be appropriate.\n\n\nStudent hours\nMany faculty call these office hours. I prefer to use the term student hours since it is what they really are. Student hours are designated times I (and all faculty and TA‚Äôs) set aside each week for students to visit me in my office. I will always be in my office during these designated times, so feel free to stop by. These hours are your chance to ask questions about the course material, about university in general, or just to chat so that we can get to know one another. Many students come to student hours after a test wondering what they need to know to prepare for an exam; however, I encourage you to come with questions before the exam. Student hours are most helpful to students if you have done some studying before coming to my office and having concrete questions about material you are struggling with. When you come in with substantive questions about the course material, I can explain a course concept a different way or help you work through a problem."

They do not override nor provide complete information about the course. You can think of this as an addendum where I can present information about how my recitation sections will operate.\n\n\nIn the first five minutes of each recitation meeting, I will post a question to the board based on that week‚Äôs material (reading or lecture). You will need to submit an answer to that question in those first five minutes. üìù\nThe purpose of the questions are for me to gauge everyone‚Äôs progress with the course. üí™ I do not want my students to fall behind and to slip through the cracks. I want to make sure that if you are struggling, that you are offered opportunities to receive help (should you choose to accept it). These questions will give me a weekly insight into where you are with the material and it gives me a sense of where the group is as a whole. This helps me customize what we focus on in recitation based on the needs of the group.\nSubmission of these questions each week will also help with taking attendance and participation. This encourages you to come to recitation and to come on time (there is not much benefit if you arrive to our recitation meeting with only 10 minutes left). If you submit a response to a question (even if you get it incorrect), you will receive credit for attendance that week. To receive credit for participation that week, a correct (or almost correct) answer to that week‚Äôs question will give you credit for the participation component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPer the policies of the course, you are able to not submit a total of three (3) of these weekly questions before you begin to lose points toward your Attendance & Participation grade. The three misses can be for any reason such as arriving late, not attending class, not answering the question, etc. This means you should use these three misses when you absolutely need them."

It is distinguished by --- to let your computer know the start and end of this section.\nThis information is not super useful, let‚Äôs add some extra customization to our yaml section. I am going to include comments denoted by # to let you know what it does.\n---\ntitle: \"PSCI 2075 Quarto Example\" # define a title for the document\nauthor: \"Damon C.

With a couple of exceptions: - To create a header use #. For subheadings, just add another #. E.g., ## creates a subheader. - To create an unumbered list, just type -; for numbered list just type the numbers. To make sublists, just type:\n- List item 1\n    - Sub list item 1\n1. Numbered list item 1\n2. Numbered list item 2\n\n\n6.3.3 Code Chunks\nIf it weren‚Äôt for R code, I‚Äôd make my life easier and skip all of this by writing all of this in a .docx or a Google Docs file. ü§¶ So let‚Äôs learn how to create a code chunk in a .qmd file. The ability to write your code and text all to display your analyses results along with your interpretation in the same document is where Quarto is powerful. üí™\n```{r}\n#| label: one-plus-one\n1+1\n```\nTo create a code chunk for R, you need to identify a few things:\n\nFirst you need to tell the .qmd file where the code chunk starts and ends. This is done with the accent symbol. You should have six of these in total. Three to designate the start of the code chunk and three at the end of the code chunk.\nAt the start of the code chunk, you need to need to specify which coding language you are evaluating in the code chunk within the brackets ({}). Since we are writing R code, we have {R}\nDirectly underneath the start of the code chunk, you can include some options about what you want to happen with the code chunk. These options are designated with #|. The option you should always specify is the label option. This option names the code chunk: one-plus-one. We do this because when we compile our .qmd file later, it tells us about the progress of our code blocks and can tell us in what code chunk there is an error in our code (which inevitably happens; even to the best of us)\n\nThere are other options that we can specify. But we‚Äôll cover these a bit later.\nOnce we have done that, then we can write our R code. In this case we want to evaluate the expression: \\(1+1\\)\n\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Inline code chunks\nSay we want to evaluate the same expression \\(1+1\\) and display the result in line with our text. We can do that by writing:\nThe result of the expression 1+1 is ```{r} sprintf('%.2f', 1+1)```.\nYou don‚Äôt need to understand all the specifics of what the sprintf('%.2f',) part does. It basically just lets you display some integer value to the hundredth decimal place. The part after the , is the R code we want evaluated. So 1+1 in this case. This all together will print the number 2 instead of you manually typing that in.\nWhy would anyone want to do that to make it more complicated? In the case of \\(1+1\\) that is a pretty simple expression with a pretty simple result. However, as things get more complicated, you may not want to have to do that manually such as calculating the average of some set of data.\n\n\n6.3.5 Non-inline results\nThe inline code chunks are primarily useful for displaying the results of some R code ‚Äúinline‚Äù with the text you are writing. But what if I have a table or a graph of some sort of results I want to display?\nThis is where specifying those other options come in handy.\nSay I write the following R code to generate a graph (we‚Äôll teach you what this R code means later)\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-chart-1\n#| fig-cap: A histogram of Penguin Bill Lengths\n\nggplot() +\n    geom_histogram(data=MY_DATASET, aes(x=bill_length)) +\n    labs(x = \"Bill Lengths\", caption=\"Data Source: Palmer Penguins\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\nDon‚Äôt worry about the R code to create the graph for now. What is important to notice about this part is, the options we specified.\n\nWith label I specify that it is going to be a figure with fig- and then finish the name with chart-1\nWith fig-cap I define a title to give the figure.\n\nWhen I compile my document and it evaluates this code block, instead of it displaying the code, it will display the figure.\nIf I want to reference the figure. I can simply type:\n\n@fig-chart-1 displays a histogram of the bill length for the penguins in the Palmer Penguins dataset.\nThis will create a link connecting back to the figure for your reader. Pretty cool!"

    "text": "7.2 Objects\nObjects represent the temporarily stored (cached) result of any operation/function in R.\nYou define objects with the assignment operator (<-).\nHere is an example:\nSay that I want to evaluate the expression \\(1+1\\). But say I want to access the result of that expression later. Either because I don‚Äôt want to rerun the code or if I want to store the result and do some other things to it later.\nI can create an object to store the result of me evaluating the expression \\(1+1\\). R stores this object in your environment (see Chapter¬†3) and will stay accessible to you until you close out of RStudio (RStudio Team 2020).\n\n# Define a = 1+1\na <- 1+1\n\nSo with the code chunk above, what does a represent?\nLet‚Äôs check:\n\nprint(a)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs say that I want to evaluate the expression \\(1+1+1\\) later in my code. But I already evaluated part of this expression with \\(1+1\\)! Since I stored the result in a, I can just evaluate the expression \\(a+1\\) which is equivalent to \\(1+1+1\\).\n\n# Evaluate a+1\nb <- a+1\n\nWe should expect that \\(b=3\\):\n\nprint(b)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n7.2.1 Functions\nFunctions are a specific type of object.\nFunctions are simply an object that takes an input and does something to that input. R is full of functions.\nSome examples of functions that we have already dealt with:\n\n<-: The input is the object and the name you want to assign the object\n+: The input are the numbers you want to sum\n\nFunctions more generally are predefined with underlying code (often very complex) that do some task for you. They are a shortcut so that you don‚Äôt have to rewrite that same code. Otherwise, everyone‚Äôs scripts would be much longer than they are.\nAs functions are a specific type of object, the whole idea behind a function is to only need to write the code once; rather than multiple times throughout a script.\nWe can write our own functions (advanced topic we aren‚Äôt going to go over), and we can access the functions written by other people to make our life easier.\nWhen someone writes a function and want to share it, they often have other related functions and code. They can package all of this code into a library and submit it to code repositories such as Github or CRAN (where you downloaded R; because what you downloaded came with basic functions like + and <-).\nIf there is a function that someone has written and packaged, you will need to install the underlying code onto your computer so that you can use it for your own work.\n\n7.2.1.1 Installing packages\nTo install a package from CRAN (often the default place to download packages from), you can use the built-in function install.packages()\n```{r}\n# Install some package called FakePackage\ninstall.packages(\"FakePackage\")\n\n# Install some package called FakePackage and another called OtherPackage\ninstall.packages(c(\"FakePackage\", \"OtherPackage\"))\n```\nThe install.package() function takes an input ‚Äì the name of the package you want to install (surrounded by quotations) ‚Äì and it will then perform some action with that input ‚Äì download the underlying code for that package and function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe input for this and other functions ARE case-sensitive.\nFor example, if I ran the following instead:\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"fakepackage\")\n```\nI would get an error!\n\n\n\n\n7.2.1.2 Loading packages\nNow, how do I use my function?\nWell, you‚Äôve downloaded the package containing the function that you want to use, but you will need to now load it to your environment. Why? Well, again, remember that functions are just a type of object. More practically, think about the number of packages some one like me has on my computer. If every time I opened R, it automatically loaded all of that code, then my computer would probably melt. So instead, I just want to specify what I want to load.\nThere are a couple of options: 1. Most people load the entire package by writing:\n```{r}\n# Load packages\nlibrary(FakePackage) # load FakePackage\n```\n\nModularly loading only the functions you want from your packages with the box package (Rudolph and Schubert 2022):\n\n```{r}\n# Load packages\nbox::use(\n    FakePackage = FakePackage[FunctionIWant, OtherFunctionIWant], # Load FunctionIWant and OtherFunctionIWant in FakePackage\n    OtherPackage = [...] # load all functions in OtherPackage\n)\n```\nWhat are the benefits of the second option?\n\nI load only the functions that I actually am going to use\nSometimes functions can be named the same thing, do different things, and are from different packages. This can create a lot of confusion and can even lead to errors in R if R is confused about what to use. Loading things purposefully, you can identify all of this before you try to run it.\nPuts less strain on my computer\nEasier to read. Now I can see what functions I got from which package rather than it just loading everything from the packages I loaded with library()\n\nTo use one of the two options:\n\nUsing library(): No extra steps, library() comes with R when you downloaded it ‚Äì from the base-r package (technically)\nUsing box::use(): Need to install the box package. And then you can just use the code from above!\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"box\")\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Team. 2020. RStudio: Integrated Development Environment for r.

Load the data by double clicking on the file\nOption 2. Write code to load the data\nFor this class only, will both options work. However, datasets come in many different forms. Sometimes data come to you as .csv files, sometimes as .dta files, sometimes in an SQL database, etc. In these cases, you will not be able to load the data by clicking on the file. You will have to write the code.\nEven for this class, you should ideally write code to load the data. Why? Well, you want everything you do for your analyses documented. Including loading the data. One of the main reasons for this is to reduce the number of steps that you have to take for you to run your analyses or for someone else to run your analyses. Writing the code that you need to load your dataset helps with this.\nTo write the code to write your data, you can simply enter:\n\n# Load my data\nload(\"psci_2075_data_file.RData\")\n\nWhat did that do?

Some will be higher than that or lower than that.\nThis motivates our need to describe a variable by not just its central tendency but also the variance or spread around the mean. There are two common metrics we can calculate to do this:\n\nThe variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\))\nThe standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\))\n\nThe difference between the two is that the standard deviation is\n\\[\n\\sigma (\\text{std. dev.}) = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2 (\\text{variance})}\n\\]"

    "text": "9.3 Easy ways to describe these with R\n\n9.3.1 Graphics\nIn R, there are tons of graphical ways that we can describe a single variable.\nA really handy website that you can use for inspiration and for example code, is R-Graph-Gallery.\nThe most popular R package for making nice-looking graphics in R is called ggplot2() (Wickham 2016).\nFor your first time using it, you should install the ggplot2() (Wickham 2016) package.\n\n# Install the ggplot2 package\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\nThen once we‚Äôve installed it, we want to make sure to load by using the library() function in our .R script before we use it.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n9.3.1.1 Histograms\nHistograms are really useful charts that we can use to visually depict the distribution of observations for a particular variable in our dataset.\nSay, for example we want to visualize the breakdown of countries‚Äô GDPPC. We can do that with a histogram.\n\nworld %>% # grab the world dataset, and do the following\n    ggplot() + # make a ggplot object\n    geom_histogram( # make a histogram\n        aes(x = log(gdppc)), # use the gdppc variable\n        fill = \"#D3D3D3\", # fill the bars with light grey\n        color = \"#000000\" # make the outlines of the bars black\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() + # change the theme to be prettier\n    labs( # clean up the labels\n        x = \"log(GDP per capita)\", # change the x-axis label to this\n        y = \"Count of countries\", # change the y-axis label to this\n        captions = \"Data source: World dataset.\" # add a caption\n    )\n\nWhat the code is doing above:\n\nGrab the world data set and use the pipe function from the magrittr package (Bache and Wickham 2022) to connect the other functions to it.\nCreate a ggplot() (Wickham 2016) object.\nI want to make a histogram, so I‚Äôm going to use ggplot (Wickham 2016) and will use the geom_histogram() function.\nInside the geom_histogram() function, I want to tell it what variable I want to plot. So I am going to use the aes() function which will grab from the world dataset object and will then grab the gdppc variable. I am going to use the log() function to log-transform it. This will make the x-axis a bit easier to read.\nFor the histogram, I want to change the default colors of the graph a bit. I want to fill in the bars with a light grey color (using a hex code) \"#D3D3D3\" and I want to make the outline of the bars black (using a hex code) \"#000000\".\nThen, I want to make the rest of the plot look a little bit prettier - so I am going to use the theme_minimal() function from the ggplot2 package.\nAlso to help make the plot a bit prettier, I am going to change some labels for the figure with the labs() function from the ggplot2 package. To change my x-axis label, I am going to set x equal to \"GDP (Per Capita)\". To change my y-axis label, I am going to set y equal to \"Count of countries\". And I want to add a caption at the bottom for my reader to know what dataset this is from, so I am going to set caption equal to \"Data source: World dataset.\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†9.1: Distribution of Countries‚Äô GDP (Per capita)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.1.2 Boxplot\nAnother common way to visually describe a variable in your data is through a boxplot. Boxplots lets us visualize not only the median (one metric of our central tendency) of a variable (the line down the middle), but also the spread through the edges of the box (which represent the first and third quartiles), and the minimum and maximum values. Any extra ‚Äúdots‚Äù that the plot shows reflects ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù ‚Äì which are observations that are quite abnormal relative to the sample.\n\nworld %>% # grab the world dataset\n    ggplot() + # make a ggplot object\n    geom_boxplot( # make a geom_boxplot\n        aes(x = log(gdppc)), # using the gdppc variable\n        fill = \"#D3D3D3\", # fill it with a light grey color\n        alpha = 0.7 # don't make the color solid\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() + # use the minimal theme to look nicer\n    labs( # adjust the labels\n        x = \"log(GDP per capita)\", # change the x axis to this\n        caption = \"Data source: World dataset.\"\n    )\n\nTo make the boxplot for the GDP (per capita) gdppc variable in the world dataset, I can run the code above.\n\nI first grab the world dataframe object\nUsing the pipe function (%>%), I connect the world dataframe object to the code below.\nI first create a ggplot object with the ggplot() function.\nI then specify that with that ggplot object, I want to make a boxplot by using the geom_boxplot() function from the ggplot2 package. I specify a couple of options. I first specify that I want to use the gdppc variable for the plot. I also indicate that I want the fill color for the plot to be light grey (hex code \"#D3D3D3\"). I then don‚Äôt want the color to be solid light grey and want to add some transparency too it, so I specify the alpha option to make it a bit more transparent.\nI then use the theme_minimal function from ggplot2 to make the plot look a bit nicer.\nFinally, I wanted to adjust the labels and so I use the labs() function from the ggplot2 function. Since I want to adjust the label for the x-axis, I specify the x option and set it equal to GDP (per capita). I also want to add a caption to indicate where I got these data from and so I use the caption option and set it equal to the text that I want for the caption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†9.2: Boxplot of GDP (per capita)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Tables\nTables are a numeric, rather than visual, way to help us understand characteristics of particular variables in our dataset.\nUnlike what we have with Figure¬†9.1, we may want concrete numerical descriptions of our data. There are a few ways we can do this.\nWe can calculate the mean of our variable by using the mean() function:\n\nmean(world$gdppc, na.rm = TRUE) # from the world dataset, grab ($) the column called gdppc\n\n[1] 16326.78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that for the mean and sd functions, I have to include an additional option (na.rm = TRUE) to ignore missing values: countries that didn‚Äôt report their GDP (per capita) in the dataset.\n\n\nWe can also calculate the standard deviation of our variable by using the sd() function:\n\nsd(world$gdppc, na.rm = TRUE) # from the world dataset, grab ($) the column called gdppc\n\n[1] 18456.59\n\n\nAdditionally, if we want to see both the mean and the median, we can use the summary() function:\n\nsummary(world$gdppc) # from the world dataset, grab ($) the column called gdppc\n\n    Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max.     NA's \n   683.8   3249.1   9863.2  16326.8  21183.4 123593.0        6 \n\n\nNotice how it doesn‚Äôt give us a calculation for our standard deviation? UGHH.\nAnother drawback to these is that the output doesn‚Äôt look all that nice and it would also require us to copy and paste things. Which opens up the chance that we accidentally copy the result for our standard deviation and refer to it as our mean in our report or we may accidentally pick the wrong number.\nOne super nifty function that we can use is the datasummary_skim() function from the modelsummary package (Arel-Bundock 2022). What the modelsummary package does, is it can calculate these things, along with quite a few others as well.\nSo, I am going to tell R to grab my world dataset object, and to apply the following functions to it ‚Äì I do this with the pipe function (%>%):\n\nWith dplyr‚Äôs (Wickham et al. 2023) mutate() function, I am going to transform the gdppc column to be the log() of it. This log transformation makes it a bit easier to read the numbers. I am going to store the result of this into a new column called log_gdppc.\nWith dplyr‚Äôs (Wickham et al. 2023) select() function, I am going to select() the log_gdppc column.\nWith dplyr‚Äôs (Wickham et al. 2023) rename() function, I am going to rename() the log_gdppc column to log(GDP per capita)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote how instead of using quotations in the rename() function, I am using the forward apostrophe symbol? I am doing this because I am technically renaming the column. So if I am using the rename() function, I should use that instead of quotations.\n\n\n\nThen, with modelsummary‚Äôs (Arel-Bundock 2022) datasummary_skim() function, I am going to make a table for the selected variables.\n\nI want to put a note on the bottom of the table telling my readers where I got the data for that variable from, so I am going to add a note that says \"Data source: world dataset.\".\nI want to have the output be easy to pull over to a .docx file, so I am going to save a .docx file called gdppc_summary.docx in my working directory (should be the psci_2075 folder on my Desktop). I can then find the file on my computer, and open with Microsoft Word or another word processor of choice by double clicking on the gdppc_summary.docx file, and then I can copy and paste the table that it opens into my report document.\n\n\n\nworld %>% # grab the world dataset\n    mutate( # change the values for a variable\n        log_gdppc = log(gdppc) # take the log of gdppc and store it in new column called log_gdppc\n    ) %>% \n    select( # grab a variable...\n        log_gdppc #... specifically the log_gdppc column, drop all the other columns\n    ) %>% \n    rename( # rename columns\n        `log(GDP per capita)` = log_gdppc # specifically rename log_gdppc to log(GDP per capita)\n    ) %>%\n    datasummary_skim( # make a table summarizing the variables\n        notes = \"Data source: world dataset.\", # add notes to bottom of table\n        output = \"gdppc_summary.docx\" # store result to a docx file called gdppc_summary.docx\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†9.1:  Descriptive statistics of countries‚Äô GDP (per capita) \n \n  \n      \n    Unique (#) \n    Missing (%) \n    Mean \n    SD \n    Min \n    Median \n    Max \n       \n  \n \n\n  \n    log(GDP per capita) \n    177 \n    3 \n    9.1 \n    1.2 \n    6.5 \n    9.2 \n    11.7 \n     \n\n\n  \n\n\n Data source: world dataset.\n Credit: damoncroberts.com\n\n\n\n\n\nIt gives me a whole bunch of things.

They have tons of examples (with code) and using either base-r plots (the uglier, but easier to create, ones) or ggplot2 (the prettier, but more verbose, ones).\nAn example .R file from Dr.¬†Philips‚Äô lecture can be found on canvas.\nTo see an example .R file for all of this (all together and in one place), can be found on this page. (You can either download the file or copy and paste its contents into your own .R file.)\nA lot of people love to jump at the chance to add all these colors to graphs and such. I am much more skeptical of this. While I love loud colors, they can be a problem in data visualization. You should not rely exclusively on color in your data visualizations as there is significant variation in people‚Äôs ability to detect and distinguish particular colors. Therefore, though it is boring, I often recommend grey scale to make it easier for everyone to see your graphs!\nAlso, you should be very careful about what types of figures you use to describe your data. You are providing a visual narrative about your data. Just as a comic book author should be conscious and careful about their choices for their illustrations, so too should an analyst be with their data visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\nArel-Bundock, Vincent. 2022. ‚Äúmodelsummary: Data and Model Summaries in R.‚Äù Journal of Statistical Software 103 (1): 1‚Äì23. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v103.i01.\n\n\nBache, Stefan Milton, and Hadley Wickham. 2022.

The cross tabulation allows us to examine how various values of one variable map onto the values of another variable.\nLet‚Äôs go through an example. Say we want to examine whether Barack Obama voters in the 2012 presidential election are more likely to believe that the police treat White citizens better than Black citizens.\nThere are a few ways that we can create a crosstab in R:\n\ntable() function: this is the most simple code, but also provides the least visual information\n\nI am going to use the table() function and will tell it to take the votes12 and disc_police variables from the nes dataset to create a crosstab. I tell it how to access those variables from the nes dataset by using the $ function (e.g., nes$vote12 and nes$disc_police).\n\n# Create crosstab with table\ntable( # use the table function\n    nes$vote12, # from the nes dataset, use the vote12 variable\n    nes$disc_police # from the nes dataset, use the disc_police variable\n)\n\n              \n               Treats whites much better Treats whites moderately better\n  Mitt Romney                         14                              48\n  Barack Obama                       245                              94\n  Someone Else                        11                              11\n  Not asked                           67                              28\n              \n               Treats whites a little better Treats both the same\n  Mitt Romney                             86                  204\n  Barack Obama                            72                   86\n  Someone Else                            17                   28\n  Not asked                               46                   92\n              \n               Treats blacks a little better Treats blacks moderately better\n  Mitt Romney                              9                               1\n  Barack Obama                             4                               4\n  Someone Else                             0                               1\n  Not asked                                4                               2\n              \n               Treats Blacks much better Skipped\n  Mitt Romney                          2       0\n  Barack Obama                         0       0\n  Someone Else                         0       0\n  Not asked                            1       1\n\n\n\nxtabs() and ftable() functions: a bit more code, but easier to read\n\nI am going to first create the crosstab using the xtabs() function. I can tell it to make a cross tab with the vote12 and disc_police variables. I am going to tell it which dataset these variables are in by using the data options. I am also going to use the ~ symbol at the front so that R knows which variable comes first. I will then use the + to let it know what the second variable is.\nI can then make the crosstab a bit more readable by then passing the result of my xtabs() function to the ftable() function.\n\n\nNotice how I do the second step differently in the code below. In the first one, I store the results of the crosstab produced with the xtabs() function into an object called tab. I then tell the ftable() function to use the tab object to make the table. In the second option, I use the %>% function instead. I tell it to grab the nes dataset, to then use the xtabs() function on the vote12 and disc_police variables in the nes dataset. I then use the %>% function again to pass the result of the xtabs() function directly to the ftable() function. This code is a bit more compact and easier to read. Either approach gets you the same result.\n\n# Option 1: Less compact code\ntab <- xtabs( # store the result in tab\n    ~ vote12 + disc_police, # use the vote12 and disc_police variables\n    data = nes # use the nes dataset for these variables\n)\nftable( # Apply the ftable function to...\n    tab # ... the tab object (defined above)\n)\n\n# Option 2: More compact code\nnes %>% # grab the nes dataset\n    xtabs( # perform the crosstab..\n        ~ vote12 + disc_police, # use the vote12 and disc_police variables\n    data = . # and use the data connected by the pipe operator (can just use .)\n    ) %>%\n    ftable()  #... and then make it look nicer with ftable\n\n\n\n             disc_police Treats whites much better Treats whites moderately better Treats whites a little better Treats both the same Treats blacks a little better Treats blacks moderately better Treats Blacks much better Skipped\nvote12                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \nMitt Romney                                     14                              48                            86                  204                             9                               1                         2       0\nBarack Obama                                   245                              94                            72                   86                             4                               4                         0       0\nSomeone Else                                    11                              11                            17                   28                             0                               1                         0       0\nNot asked                                       67                              28                            46                   92                             4                               2                         1       1\n\n\n\ndatasummary_crosstab() from the modelsummary package (Arel-Bundock 2022): code is much cleaner, so is output.\n\nA third option for making crosstab is to use the datasummary_crosstab() function from the modelsummary package. I personally think these crosstabs are a bit easier to read and are a bit cleaner. As they are tables produced from the same package we used to do univariate descriptive statistics, we can use very similar code to produce these crosstabs!\nFirst, I am going to take the nes dataset and am going to tell R to apply the datasummary_crosstab() function to it. In the options for the functions, I am going to tell it to use the disc_police and vote12 variables. I am going to also tell it to add a note to the bottom of the table that lets the reader know the dataset you used here. Since I am using the %>% function, I can use the shortcut . to tell it what dataset I am using. Using the %>% already let R know that I am using the nes dataset so I do not need to write it out in that option. Finally, I am going to tell R to save the table from the crosstab in a word document called bivariate_crosstab.docx. I can then open the file after I‚Äôve run the code, and then copy and paste the results into my main report or assignment for the class!\n\nnes %>% # grab the nes dataset\n    datasummary_crosstab( # use the datasummary_crosstab on it\n        disc_police ~ vote12, # using the disc_police and vote12 variables\n        notes = \"Data source: NES dataset.\", # add notes to table\n        data = ., # using the dataset connected by the pipe operator\n        output = \"bivariate_crosstab.docx\" # store result in the word document bivariate_crosstab.docx\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    disc_police \n      \n    Mitt Romney \n    Barack Obama \n    Someone Else \n    Not asked \n    All \n  \n \n\n  \n    Treats whites much better \n    N \n    14 \n    245 \n    11 \n    67 \n    337 \n  \n  \n     \n    % row \n    4.2 \n    72.7 \n    3.3 \n    19.9 \n    100.0 \n  \n  \n    Treats whites moderately better \n    N \n    48 \n    94 \n    11 \n    28 \n    181 \n  \n  \n     \n    % row \n    26.5 \n    51.9 \n    6.1 \n    15.5 \n    100.0 \n  \n  \n    Treats whites a little better \n    N \n    86 \n    72 \n    17 \n    46 \n    221 \n  \n  \n     \n    % row \n    38.9 \n    32.6 \n    7.7 \n    20.8 \n    100.0 \n  \n  \n    Treats both the same \n    N \n    204 \n    86 \n    28 \n    92 \n    410 \n  \n  \n     \n    % row \n    49.8 \n    21.0 \n    6.8 \n    22.4 \n    100.0 \n  \n  \n    Treats blacks a little better \n    N \n    9 \n    4 \n    0 \n    4 \n    17 \n  \n  \n     \n    % row \n    52.9 \n    23.5 \n    0.0 \n    23.5 \n    100.0 \n  \n  \n    Treats blacks moderately better \n    N \n    1 \n    4 \n    1 \n    2 \n    8 \n  \n  \n     \n    % row \n    12.5 \n    50.0 \n    12.5 \n    25.0 \n    100.0 \n  \n  \n    Treats Blacks much better \n    N \n    2 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    3 \n  \n  \n     \n    % row \n    66.7 \n    0.0 \n    0.0 \n    33.3 \n    100.0 \n  \n  \n    Skipped \n    N \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n  \n  \n     \n    % row \n    0.0 \n    0.0 \n    0.0 \n    100.0 \n    100.0 \n  \n  \n    All \n    N \n    364 \n    505 \n    68 \n    241 \n    1178 \n  \n  \n     \n    % row \n    30.9 \n    42.9 \n    5.8 \n    20.5 \n    100.0 \n  \n\n\n Data source: NES dataset.\n Credit: damoncroberts.com\n\n\n\n\nNotice how we‚Äôve got a few different options to choose from here. One additional thing to make our interpretation a bit easier is to clean the variables. Again, remember the primary goal of my analysis from the start was to examine whether or not people that voted for Barack Obama in the 2012 election felt that Black Americans are more discriminated against by the police or not. This implies that we can compare folks that voted for Obama to those who did not and only on whether they felt that Black Americans were targets of discrimination by the police or not. This means that for my particular analysis here, I can turn these two variables into a dichotomous variable to help me examine my question. One variable that reflects whether the respondent voted for Barack Obama or not and a second variable that reflects whether the respondent indicates that Black Americans are not treated better by the police or those who believe that Black Americans are compared to Whites.\nRecall from the previous exercise on the basics of cleaning data, that we can take advantage of the super nifty functions provided by the dplyr (Wickham et al. 2023) package for data cleaning.\nI am going to take the nes dataset and am going to select() the two columns I am interested in examining.\nSince I am going to be trying to make new columns using the vote12 and disc_police columns, I can use the mutate() function. First, I am going to create a new column called vote12_clean that has a value of 1 if the respondent voted for Obama and a value of 0 if they voted for Mitt Romney or Someone Else.\nThen, I am going to add value labels with the factor() function where people that have a value of 0 for the newly created vote12_clean variable have a label of ‚ÄúNot Obama‚Äù and a label of ‚ÄúObama‚Äù if they did vote for Obama (a value of 1).\nI am going to do a similar thing with the disc_police variable. For people that do not indicate that the police treat Black Americans better, they will have a value of 0 in the new disc_police_clean variable. Those that say that police do treat Black Americans better will now have a value of 1 in the new disc_police_clean variable.

    "text": "11.2 Visual\n\n11.2.1 Boxplots\nJust as we can with univariate summaries, we can visually depict bivariate summaries. One of the more powerful ways to do this if you have at least one categorical variable is to use a boxplot. In the previous exercise, we used a boxplot for a univariate description. In that example, we only specified a variable for the x-axis. For a bivariate case, we can put a categorical variable on the x-axis and a variable on the y-axis.\nSay we want to examine the composition of states‚Äô murder rate that voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential election relative to states that did not vote for Donald Trump. We can use a categorical variable that documents whether Trump won the state or lost the state. We can put this categorical variable on the x-axis. For the y-axis, we can use a variable documenting the state‚Äôs murder rate.\nWe can use the states dataset as it has both of these variables. The first variable, trumpwin, documents whether Trump won or lost in a given state. The second variable, murderrate, documents the murder rate per capita in a state.\nTo make the box plot, we can run the following code:\n\nstates %>% # grab the states dataset\n    mutate( # create a new column based on an existing one\n        trumpwin_clean = factor( # create a column trumpwin_clean with value labels\n            trumpwin, # use the existing trumpwin variable for this\n            labels = c(\n                \"Loss\", # for the first value (0), label it Loss\n                \"Won\" # for the second value (1), label it Won\n            ),\n            ordered = TRUE # the order of the values and labels matter\n        )\n    ) %>% # after I've done this, now I can make a plot\n    ggplot() + # make a ggplot object\n    geom_boxplot( # make a box plot\n        aes(\n            x = trumpwin_clean, # where the x-axis is whether trump won or not\n            y = murderrate # and the y-axis is the murder rate in the state\n        ),\n        fill = \"#D3D3D3\" # fill the boxplot with a light grey color\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() + # add the minimal theme to look prettier\n    labs( # clean up the labels\n        x = \"Trump won state\", # change x-axis label to this\n        y = \"Murder rate per capita\", # change y-axis label to this\n        caption = \"Data source: States dataset.\" # add caption\n    )\n\nHere is a break down of what this code does:\n\nI am going to grab the states dataset and use the pipe function (%>%) to chain all of the code together. This makes it so that R knows that I am referring to the states dataset for the the code connected by pipe functions.\nI am going to use some of my data cleaning skills learned in the previous exercise and am going to add value labels to the trumpwin variable. I do this because I want it to be easier for me to keep track of what a 0 means for the trumpwin variable versus a 1. So to add these value labels, I am going to use the built-in factor() function. With dplyr‚Äôs mutate() function (Wickham et al. 2023), I am able to tell R that I am going to create a new column using information from an existing variable. I am going to create a new variable called trumpwin_clean that will have the value labels defined by the factor() function. So I am going to tell it that I am going to be using the trumpwin variable and am going to add the value labels of ‚ÄúLoss‚Äù and ‚ÄúWin‚Äù to the variable. So values of 0 in the trumpwin variable will be labelled as ‚ÄúLoss‚Äù in the trumpwin_clean variable and values of 1 in trumpwin will be labelled as ‚ÄúWin‚Äù. I am also going to set the ordered option equal to TRUE because I want to respect the order of the values in the original trumpwin variable.\nNow I can make a plot. So I am going to use the ggplot() function to tell R, that after you‚Äôve done the previous things, now I am going to make a plot.\nI am going to use the geom_boxplot() function to tell R that the plot I told it I want to make will be a boxplot. Within that function, I am going to provide a couple of options. I am going to tell it that I want to make the x-axis of the boxplot the new variable that I created with the value labels, trumpwin_clean. I am also going to tell it that the y-axis should be the murderrate variable. Finally, I am going to tell it that I want the color of the boxes to be filled in with a light grey color.\nI want to make the plot prettier so I am going to use the theme_minimal() function to apply that theme to the plot\nI am also going to add cleaner labels to the plot as well. So I am going to use the labs() function to tell it that I want the x-axis to be labeled as ‚ÄúTrump won state‚Äù, the y-axis to be ‚ÄúMurder rate per capita‚Äù, and to add a caption to the bottom that says ‚ÄúData source: States dataset.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot of Trump winning and murder rate for a state"

These questions are referred to as feeling thermometers where respondents can choose on a scale from 0-100, how warmly they feel toward the person or group or how cold their feelings are toward them. There is a feeling thermometer for Obama, ftobama, and for the LGBTQIA+ community, ftgay, in the nes dataset.\nUsing functions from the ggplot2 package (Wickham 2016), I can make a scatter plot for these.\n\nnes %>% # grab the nes dataset and apply the following\n    ggplot() + # create a ggplot object\n    geom_point( # make this plot a scatterplot\n        aes(\n            x = ftobama, # use the ftobama variable for the x-axis\n            y = ftgay # use the ftgay variable for the y-axis\n        ),\n        color = \"#000000\", # add black for outline of points\n        fill = \"#D3D3D3\", # add grey to fill of points\n        alpha = 0.5 # add transparency to each point\n    ) + \n    theme_minimal() + # use the minimal theme to make prettier\n    labs( # adjust the labels\n        x = \"Feeling thermometer: Obama\", # change the x-axis label to this\n        y = \"Feeling thermometer: LGBTQIA+\", # change the y-axis label to this\n        caption = \"Data source: NES dataset.\" # add this as the caption\n    )\n\nHere‚Äôs what this code does:\n\nTake the nes dataset and apply the following to it.\nMake a ggplot() object\nSpecifically, make a scatter plot with the geom_point() function. For this scatterplot, I want the x-axis to be the ftobama variable and the y-axis variable to be the ftgay variable. I want to make the outline color of the circles to be black and the fill color of the circles to be light grey. I want the dots to be somewhat transparent so I am going to set the alpha to 0.5.\nThen, I want to use the minimal theme for the plot, so I am going to use the theme_minimal() function.\nI also want to change the labels on the plot. So using the labs() function, I am going to tell the x-axis to be labelled as ‚ÄúFeeling thermometer: Obama‚Äù, the y-axis to be labelled as ‚ÄúFeeling thermometer: LGBTQIA+‚Äù, and add a caption to indicate that the data source is the ‚ÄúNES dataset.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†11.1: Feeling thermometer of Obama and the LGBTQIA+ community"
