## Main panel

- This is where you will write all of your code.
    - As we will talk about in the next section, your code is passed/sent to the `console` which actually is what evaluates/runs your code. 
    - However, you need to document your code. So you will write a `script` so that you can save all of the code you wrote. Think of a script as a document outlining the steps you took to perform your analysis.
    - You write your `script` in this main panel

## Console

- When you run code from a `script`, you send your code to your R `console`. This is done by either highlighting your code and using the shortcut <kbd>ctrl enter</kbd> (<kbd> âŒ˜ return </kbd> on Mac) or hitting the `run` button at the top of your main panel.
- The code you write is evaluated and ran by your R `console`.

## Terminal

- The `terminal` is also an area to run code. This often runs a different coding language (i.e. `bash`) which is a coding language that tells your computer what to do from a systems standpoint. 

## Environment

- The `environment` displays your `cached` (temporarily saved) `objects` that you create with your R code.
    - We will elaborate a bit more later on this point.
- But this lets you see things that you've temporarily stored from your code. 

## Files

- Let's you see what files and where you have them on your computer.
