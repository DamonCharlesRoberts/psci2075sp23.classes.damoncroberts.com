## Options

I'll cover two primary ways that you can execute R code in R Studio:

1. `script` ðŸ«¤
2. `quarto` ðŸ¤©

:::{.callout-note}
The default for this class will be to write a `script` (`.R` file) and then copy and paste results into a Word or Google Doc. ðŸ«¤

Though there are a few extra steps, my preference is `quarto` (`.qmd`), however. ðŸ¤© You'll see why in a second.
:::

## Script (`.R`) ðŸ«¤

- A file denoted with the `.R` file extension
- A file specifically designed to send code to an R `console`.
- Only allows you to evaluate R code.
- Have to take the results of your script and place them in a document for your reports/papers/etc.

## Quarto (`.qmd`) ðŸ¤©

- A file denoted with the `.qmd` file extension
- A file that allows you to not only write R code and to evaluate it but it also:
    - lets you evaluate other coding languages too (e.g., python)
    - uses `code chunk`s which evaluates the R code, but also lets you write text around the `chunk`.
- This is useful if you want to write a paper or report that requires you to evaluate some type of code in it
    - You write your code and the other parts of your paper **all in the same document** ðŸ˜®
    - You `render` the file and it evaluates the code in your `chunk`s and spits out the result of the code in the document along with your text.
- Allows you to compile documents of many different file types
    - documents
        - HTML 
        - PDF
        - DOCX
    - slide decks (presentations)
        - PDF
        - PPT
        - a very pretty and interactive JavaScript
    - websites
    - books
        - HMTL
        - PDF
- This site that you are reading right now was created with `.qmd`.
- To set all of this up though, it requires slightly extra work... ðŸ™€
